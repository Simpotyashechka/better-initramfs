* Support loadable kernel modules.
* Support for key on external device (enc_keydev and enc_keyfile).
* Support for squashfs in root variable, example: root=SQUASHFS=livecd.img
* Support for aufs3-based rootfs (livesystem). Useful for debuging and liveUSB/CD.
* Better support for keymaps.
* Support BTRFS's subvolumes.
* Support for remote unlock of multiple luks device (Note to self: check whatever fifo is open)
* earlymount option to mount everything possible from /newroot/etc/fstab - that should be good idea if we want to have mountpoints in /var/log for example.
